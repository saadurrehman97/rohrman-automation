"""Reuse a purchase order the invoice already names.

THE PROBLEM
    Sublet and Misc invoices always created a NEW purchase order, even when the
    invoice plainly printed the number of one that already existed in Tekion.
    The clerk who raised that PO then had two: the real one, still open, and
    ours, carrying the invoice.

THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER
    Read the number off the invoice, look it up, and if it is there ask whether
    to use it. Nothing here decides on its own to post against a purchase order
    somebody else raised -- that is a person's call, and the pipeline stops and
    asks for it.

    Everything this needs already existed for the vendor stock-order flow, which
    has always invoiced against a PO rather than creating one:

        ocr_helpers.get_po_number()          the number on the page
        TekionApiClient.find_purchase_order() the exact-match lookup
        TekionApiClient.pre_invoice()         takes any PO's id/number/universalId

    So this module is the decision, not the plumbing.

WHAT THE PO RECORD TELLS US
    The search hit carries `invoiceStatus` and `invoiceNumbers`. The second is
    the useful one and is easy to miss:

        "invoiceNumbers": [
            {"invoiceId": "6aa2b5c8...", "invoiceNumber": "989872",
             "paymentTime": 1789048264640}
        ]

    That is what makes "already pre-invoiced" answerable as "already
    pre-invoiced WITH THIS INVOICE", which is the question that matters. A PO
    carrying a different invoice number is a second bill against one order --
    common and legitimate -- while the same number twice is the one thing that
    must not post.
