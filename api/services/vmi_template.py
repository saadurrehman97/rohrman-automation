"""Fill a dealership's Tekion auto-posting template from an annotated invoice.

THE MODEL, CORRECTED
    An earlier version of this flow carried a hardcoded set of GL accounts per
    manufacturer. That was backwards. The accounts are not ours to decide: each
    dealership's own journal-70 auto-posting template already lists them, and
    the clerk annotating the invoice writes those same account numbers on the
    page next to the amount each one takes.

    So the job is a JOIN, not a lookup table:

        Tekion template  ->  which GL accounts this store posts to, in order
        invoice writing  ->  how much goes in some of them
        the invoice      ->  the printed figures the rest are derived from

    That is why the same code works for Kia, Ford, Honda and Toyota without a
    per-make table: what differs between manufacturers is which amounts get
    written on the page, and the template already says where they land.

WHERE EACH LINE'S AMOUNT COMES FROM, IN ORDER
    1. An annotation naming that GL account. The clerk wrote "2245" with an
       arrow to 780.00, so 2245 takes 780.00. This wins over everything --
       it is a person stating the answer.
    2. A ROLE the template describes. "Vehicle floor plan amount" is the whole
       dealer cost as a credit; "Vehicle Invoice Price" is dealer cost minus
       holdback. These are computed, never written down, and the template's own
       line descriptions are what identify them.
    3. The template's preset amount. Some pairs are fixed at the store -- the
       DOC fee sits in the template as 380.00 / -380.00 -- and simply carry.
    4. Nothing. The line is dropped rather than posted at zero.

MIRROR LINES
    Templates pair a receivable with its income/payable account: DMA 150.00
    against DMA_ -150.00. The trailing underscore is the convention. When the
    first of a pair is filled from an annotation, its mirror follows with the
    sign flipped, because nobody writes the same number twice on an invoice.

WHY AN ACCOUNT NUMBER IS NOT ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY A LINE
    This module used to take {account -> amount}, which assumes each account
    appears once. Schaumburg Honda disproves it. Its template posts to 2248
    three times -- as DMA, as HTB, and as FLOORASST -- and to 2320 twice, once
    for the vehicle and once for the DOC fee. The clerk writes 2248 three times
    too, with a different figure each time.

    A dictionary keeps the last of those and drops the rest, so an invoice
    carrying 150 / 641.93 / 428 against 2248 posted 428 three times and came out
    39,052.78 short.

    The template already says which is which: its `description` field holds the
    very words the clerk writes beside the number -- "DMA", "HTB", "FLOORASST",
    "FUELALLOWANCE" -- and OCR returns that word in `mapped_description`. So an
    annotation is (account, amount, label) and the join is on the PAIR, with the
    account alone as the fallback for the stores that annotate without labels.

SIGNS
    The magnitude is the clerk's; the direction is usually the template's. But
    where a template line has no preset to take a sign from and plays no role,
    the minus sign on the page is the only evidence there is -- "3010A -641.93"
    is a credit and posting it as a debit is how the HTB and FLOORASST pairs
    both came out doubled instead of cancelling.
